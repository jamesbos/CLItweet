CLItweet v0.1.1 - pronounced C.L.I tweet or K-LIE-TWEET
--------
Allows raw tweeting from the command line with a few other options.
Written totally in PHP with a few bash commands thrown in for good measure.

INSTALLATION
------------
1) Twitter uses OAuth - You need to register an application
at http://dev.twitter.com
2) Change the Access Level in OAuth settings and Your Access Token to Read, Write.
3) Copy the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret Access Token and Access Token Secret
and paste them into the relevant fields in the tweet file.

REQUIRMENTS
-----------
PHP5, PHP-CLI and PHP-CURL should be all you need to be running.
No Apache or anything else required.

USAGE
-----
clitweet	-s "your message here" [""'s to encapsulate single qoutes and other special char's]
		-U [tweets your uptime]
		-h [displays help]

NOTES
-----
Since your messages are executed in the shell, you can append super globals such as
$HOSTNAME etc. You can even set a cron job to tweet certain things also, for example
use cron to tweet your uptime or when a new mail arrives. Endless possibilities!

WISHLIST
--------
*Option to automate uploading text into pastebin and posting link
